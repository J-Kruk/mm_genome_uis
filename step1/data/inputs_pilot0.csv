In a somewhat more obvious way, lightning is a physical side-effect of massive amounts of electrical potential energy.

The glowing white color of lightning is associated with other things that carry an energetic connotation like lightbulbs.

Whereas the example for american food had turkey and roast vegetables, this example has hummus, bread, tabouleh, and fresh vegetables.
A100,American,104,Folklore & myth,,yes,,no,The image is just a picture of a tortoise in the woods, it doesn't give any context that the artwork somehow ties to a narrative with ethical and moral connotations.,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQE5Axyp5sWEFQ/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1685461046624?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=AtxRV9YiBhncz24mrqAEn5lqyr1Q4aOv9pIu0_yGCvA,campfire story,4,This image represents the concept of folklore and myth because it shows people sitting around a campfire, probably sharing pieces of folklore with each other. The provided image is just scene from a specific folk story which lacks critical context that could demonstrate to the viewer what it actually is.

It is a good representation because it shows the act of the tattoo being applied. The act of getting a tattoo applied in itself is an important ceremony for tattoo-havers.
A100,American,98,emotions,Relief,yes,,no,The image looks like it is trying to literally show someone having a 'weight' (as in a weightlifting weight) lifted off their shoulders. The weightlifting imagery isn't consistent with the meaning of the phrase.,https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg0eW9g-uKzTgrJwoarhDygUd3wBkZYWLwbcnrD4UzrdQqooLR2xZKLUGTHvhHbEsRxtRW8QaCghylDnHueqMYW_WgmA9S-5ri8Aotj_TZrbqqONySmREQUjMtusG8bfHX5Amn5E_2rkgDe/s1600/2013-04-03_1258.png,weight lifted off shoulders,0,This image doesn't have the weightlifting-adjacent feeling of the other image, which makes it more intelligible to me. Also, the previous image just didn't look right, aside from a couple faces I couldn't tell what was what. This image is crude and weird looking but it looks right.

A001,Indian,40,color symbolism,Energetic,no,In my culture red is definitely associated with energy and passion, but not uniquely so. All bright colors are considered passionate and energetic. While red is a common color, a bright blue orgreen would be just as festive. Specifically, in my culture brides wear yellow sarees during the main wedding ceremony. Some cultures even wear white sarees in weddings. So while this might be true for many cultures, it isn't true for all of them,,,,,,

A001,Indian,73,cooking,Special Event foods,yes,,no,The distribution of food in the plate is very wrong. There's a lot of chutney, and very little sabji. There's also a bowl full of salad. There's no indian bread in the plate, and the plate looks like it's filled with some form of liquid. In my culture, there's a very specific way to plate up food. There is a specific spot for each item (lentils, dry sabjis, liquid sabjis, rice, bread, sweets,salads, chutneys, salt, lemon, papads, etc) and a specific portion size of each of these. This image lacks such structure.,https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e9/1a/80/e91a8039279d02631c34e31ac1f77117.jpg,https://www.pinterest.com/pin/70437486176247/,0,While not exactly perfectly laid out, this image contains a much better representation of what a north Indian thali would look like.

A001,Indian,104,Folklore & myth,,yes,,no,The image has a lot of AI bugs, like extra hands and such, but the main thing that make it a poor representation of the myth of Ram and Sita is Ram in the image is wearing women's clothes. Ram never dressed in women's clothing in the story of Ramayan.

A001,Indian,98,emotions,Relief,no,As far as I know there is no such special significance with the color green. While greenery and fresh air is considered good for one's mind and health it isn't any more important than other cultures. There is some emphasis on nature being peaceful, but nothing signficant about the color green to my knowledge.,,,,,,
